# Module 6: Accessing AWS Cloud Services<a name="module6"></a>

This advanced module shows you how AWS Greengrass cores can interact with other Amazon Web Services in the cloud\. It builds on the traffic light example in [Module 5](module5.md) and uses an additional Lambda function that processes shadow states and uploads a summary to an Amazon DynamoDB table\.

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed [Module 1](module1.md) through [Module 5](module5.md)\. You do not need other components or devices\. This module should take about 30 minutes to complete\.

**Note**  
This module creates and updates a table in DynamoDB â€“ most of the operations are small and fall within the AWS Free Tier\. See [DynamoDB pricing documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/) for more information\.
