# Module 4: Interacting with Devices in an AWS Greengrass Group<a name="module4"></a>

This module shows you how AWS IoT devices can connect to and communicate with an AWS Greengrass core device\. AWS IoT devices that connect to an AWS Greengrass core are part of an AWS Greengrass group and can participate in the AWS Greengrass programming paradigm\. In this module, one AWS Greengrass device sends a "Hello World" message to another AWS Greengrass device within the AWS Greengrass group:
